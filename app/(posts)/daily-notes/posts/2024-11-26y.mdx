# 2024-11-26

<div className="mt-5 mb-5">

</div>

Math from 7:30 -> 10:30, did well. 

Brainstormed some experiments for a while. 
11:00 started doing some lit review. 

11:30 -> 1:30 Very caffeinated today. Absolutely smashed together some experiment ideas / hypos'. Might share later. 

Here's some graphs from the toy model experiment I'm cooking up.

5:22 -> just spent like two hours 'fixing' what I thought was a bug, turns out it is not a bug. 

guess which features are in superposition!
