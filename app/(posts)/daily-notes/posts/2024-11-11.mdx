Math from 7:50 -> 12:30

Back to ARENA again today. 

most useful diagram in the section, should have been much earlier IMO:

5:00, finished mech interp chapter 1.2

Important note by the big NN re toy models (I need to keep in mind - scientific method is not 'do something pretty' -> 'make up hypothesis after')

> The right mindset for a toy model project is to take the process of setting up the toy model really seriously. 
Find something about a transformer that you're confused about, and try to distill it down to a toy model. 
Then try to red-team it, and think through ways it's disanalogous real models, and note down all of the assumptions you're making. (Easier to do with a friend! Outside perspectives are great)
Then try to actually analyse the toy model, regularly keeping in mind the confusion about real models that you're trying to understand, and checking in on whether you've lost track.
As you go deeper, you'll likely see ways the toy model could be more analogous, and can tweak the setup to be more true to the underlying confusion
