Yo. This is the first note of the summer. Today I brushed off the last snaggles of exam fatigue and started thinking about how this summer is going to look. 

* I'm planning on full sending it into mech interp projects / research (while keeping up with my math, etc).
Four months is a long time, and right now I feel like I have all the time in the world, but I know it's going to go quicker than anything. Hopefully 
I can document as much as possible... 'artifact' generation seems to be the only way to tie yourself down when everything around you moves this fast. 

* I want to spend as little of these four months doing things manually where I could automate them, especially re Mech Interp stuff. As I go I want to automate
as much of my research workflow as I can. Hopefully I can make some of this stuff public, but I'm not going to be trying to solve everyones workflow, just mine. 

* I'm going to be trying to be more purposeful with my note taking - right now this looks like throwing any terms / formulas / concepts I don't understand 
into anki. I've used spaced repetition in the past (I decided it would be a good idea to take a biology class (it was not)). Hopefully this will make bringing ideas down into 
working memory for triangulation and cross-pollination easier.
