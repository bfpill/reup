# 2024-11-20

<div className="mt-5 mb-5">

8:30 -> 11:40 did lots of integrals


Today I want to take a break from training models and stuff and build a superposition geometry visualization widget, where you pass in a
weight matrix and it isolates sections of features in superposition, and then calculates a possible geometry. Not completely sure on the 
math yet, but it should be something like converting the cosine sim to a distance, and then forcing the points to all conform to a 
set of distances (not sure how thats going to work yet). Then I can draw lines between points? or from the origin to the points, or something
to represent shape. Maybe all points that share a dimension get an edge.
