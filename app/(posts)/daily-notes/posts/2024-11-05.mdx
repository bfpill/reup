9:00 - Worked for a little while on the ARENA mech interp chapters while messing with the CA training. I got impatient with the model and paused it to try out
training with differentiable update rules (done using sigmoid), but that didn't really work out super well, low loss but model was clearly not learning so something was wrong. 
Also tried some very poor RL where I would sample from the logits as actions and then try to use that in the loss function, but it didn't work at all (all this to get around non-differentiable update rules). 
I think just input/output pairs is the way to go, maybe a big enough dataset is all you need.

1:11 - Just finished up polishing the site so daily posts are all bundled together in one big scroll. All posts are concatenated into a huge MDX and rolled together. 
It makes the posts much more readable as work can flow over from one day to the next. Might change up the landing page to make it more homely.
