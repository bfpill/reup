# Research

## Interpreting Complexity - *Singular Learning Theory for Interpretability* - *March 2025*
Self-led research into using Singular Learning Theory (SLT) ideas for interpretability. Introduce novel interpretability and SLT tools. Published findings on LessWrong. Currently a first author on a related full paper in progress with collaborators.

## A Contrastive Analysis of Features in Twin Toy Transformers that (play) Chess - *November 2024*
I trained SAE's and found very interpretable features in models trained to predict legal chess moves! Features interactive neuron browsers for exploring the models and interactive graphs, all written in typescript. Models trained using Torch.

Over two days, I built a tool which let a language model-driven evolutionary algorithm mutate your website's stylesheet to maximize customer engagement.[ðŸ”— Read the writeup](https://max.v3rv.com/writing/darwin)

## NotionAiOS *Python, Typescript* - 2023
A ChatGPT plugin experiment. Allowed ChatGPT to use Notion as a filesystem and iteratively write larger codebases. The user could interact with the generated code and download it as a zip, as well as share it to a public Notion database of generated projects.
