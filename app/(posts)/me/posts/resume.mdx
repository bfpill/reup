# Projects

## A Contrastive Analysis of Features in Twin Toy Transformers that (play) Chess - *Machine Learning Research Paper*
[ðŸ”— Read the paper](https://max.v3rv.com/papers/chess)

I find very interpretable features in models trained to predict legal chess moves! Features interactive neuron browsers for exploring the models and interactive graphs, all written in React + D3. Models were trained using Torch.


## Darwin.ai - Founders Hack 2024 Highest Technical Score - *Python, React*
[ðŸ”— Read the writeup](https://max.v3rv.com/writing/darwin)

My team built a web app that lets you add a line of code to your frontend and watch your website evolve in real-time. The idea was that we could use some kind of customer engagement metric from your site (clicks, checkouts, etc) to guide an evolutionary algorithm which mutates your css in order to improve said metric.

## Story Search *Python, Typescript*
[ðŸ”— Visit the project](https://unihack-2024-story-search.vercel.app)

Unihack 2024 project, built over 48 hours using React + Python. Generated children's picture books from search queries. Generated outputs are cached in a vector database, allowing compute cost to scale super nicely as the user base grows. 

## NotionAiOS *Python, Typescript*
[ðŸ”— View on GitHub](https://quark-grin-e5c.notion.site/244fbd2336dc46d5a2612c7dc9609f67?v=1167f2242f9f487582b223ba4aa3c920)

A ChatGPT plugin experiment. Allowed ChatGPT to use notion as a filesystem and iteratively write larger codebases. The user could interact with the generated code and download it as a zip, as well as share it to a public Notion database of generated projects.  

## Gekko *Python, Typescript*
[ðŸ”— View on GitHub](https://github.com/bfpill/Gekko)

The Humane pin before the Humane pin (joking). Realtime OpenAI Whisper linked to Langchain and then ported to Notion. Listens to conversations then classifies and stores them in a Notion Database.

## Very Fast CPU Conway's Game Of Life *C++*
[ðŸ”— View on GitHub](https://github.com/bfpill/fast_life/tree/master)

A first attempt at writing fast code for the CPU, and a fun experiment into multithreading in C++.  Can render to the terminal (slower) or can pop-up a window rendering pixels with GLUT. 

Published IOS / Android App *React Native, Python*

Developed and published an IOS app as paid commission work for a large business. Wrote and automated python scripts to scrape thousands of songs and images/text from the companies websites in order to create a working database.
